# 360_560

This folder is reserved for MTX Operating System Coding Project I wrote in Professor Wang's 360 460 560 (550) classes. 
This is the project I am most proud of myself in WSU. (I guess many of WSU CS students will feel the same way~) 

As a teaching assistant for 360, I am reluctant to post my codes though. 

If you are an potential employer and want to review these codes, please contact me at xiyu.xie@gmail.com. 
I will be more than happy to email them to you. 

If you are a current student taking these courses you can catch me in my office, SLOAN 330.
I am more than happy to help you at my best effort.
Also, if you have found previous students' code in git or other sources, please try not to reply on them.
You will get as much out of K.C.'s classes as you put into them.
